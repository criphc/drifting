I cannot say how good Void Stranger is just like Outer Wilds, spoilers will ruin all its fun. Those who made the game, System Erasure, even hides the main game mechanic that you would encounter in the first minute in all its press materials. It only cost you 12 dollars yet it has all you would expect for a good indie game: 

- well designed, hand-made puzzles
    - and hundreds of them, from simple tutorial levels to exceptionally hard and complex ones
    - with knowledge-based progression like Tunic
- layers and layers of secrets like Animal Well, and similar replayability
    - with a community made wiki organized on par with the Minecraft wiki
- fantastic UI, animation, sound and art design despite being 4-bit grayscale pixel art
- a soundtrack that worth buying just on its own
  - I may have looped too much Buzzing Boogie but still enjoys it every time

- small but very pleasing details scattered throughout the game
    - quality of life features and small hints and tutorials
    - used as a narrative device
    - and many references to other works
- made by only two Finnish guys


The only thing I want to complain is the story: it is good and very well written, but, uhh, itâ€™s kinda weeb. The story is surely in Anime style, but the plot is actually good and not weeb. The other thing is many game mechanics in the late game after the main storyline are not explained to my content, but it is understandable since the developers has already extended the game to almost triple its original length and you better ship it soon before it becomes another N1RV Ann-A.
